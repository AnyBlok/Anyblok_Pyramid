Information about the AnyBlok / Pyramid project.

Project Homepage
----------------

AnyBlok is hosted on `github <http://github.com>`_ - the main project
page is at https://github.com/AnyBlok/AnyBlok_Pyramid. Source code is
tracked here using `GIT <https://git-scm.com>`_.

Releases and project status are available on Pypi at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anyblok_pyramid.

The most recent published version of this documentation should be at
http://doc.anyblok-pyramid.anyblok.org.

Project Status
--------------

AnyBlok with Pyramid is currently in beta status and is expected to be fairly
stable.   Users should take care to report bugs and missing features on an as-needed
basis.  It should be expected that the development version may be required
for proper implementation of recently repaired issues in between releases;

Installation
------------

Install released versions of AnyBlok from the Python package index with
`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ or a similar tool::

    pip install anyblok_pyramid

Installation via source distribution is via the ``setup.py`` script::

    python setup.py install

Installation will add the ``anyblok`` commands to the environment.

Unit Test
---------

Run the test with ``nose``::

    pip install nose
    nosetests anyblok_pyramid/tests

Dependencies
------------

AnyBlok works with **Python 3.3** and later. The install process will
ensure that `AnyBlok <http://doc.anyblok.org>`_,
`Pyramid <http://pyramid.readthedocs.org/>`_ are installed, in addition to
other dependencies. The latest version of them is strongly recommended.
